This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

You can use this to initialize the project

```bash
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Front End Dev - Onboarding
Technical Problem: Copy ‘block.xyz’
Task:
Create a responsive web page that replicates the homepage of the website block.xyz.
Requirements:

1. HTML Structure:
   ● Recreate the basic HTML structure of the block.xyz homepage.
   ● Include all sections such as the header, navigation menu, main content
   areas, and footer.
   ● Ensure to include placeholders for any interactive elements (e.g., buttons,
   forms).
2. CSS Styling:
   ● Use CSS to closely match the styling of block.xyz.
   ● Ensure the layout is responsive and looks good on both desktop and
   mobile devices.
   ● Use Flexbox or Grid for the layout.
   ● Apply styles to match the fonts, colors, spacing, and other visual elements
   as closely as possible.
3. JavaScript Functionality:
   ● Use vanilla JavaScript (or optionally a framework like React, Vue.js, or
   Angular) to implement any interactive elements found on the block.xyz
   homepage.
   ● Ensure that any buttons, forms, or dynamic content behave similarly to the
   original site.
4. API Integration (if applicable):
   ● If the block.xyz homepage includes dynamic data fetched from an API,
   replicate this functionality using a mock API or a similar public API.
   ● Ensure that the data is displayed and updated correctly.
5. Additional Features (Optional):
   ● Implement smooth scrolling for any anchor links.
   ● Add a loading indicator for dynamic content.
   ● Provide detailed comments in the code to explain the implementation.
